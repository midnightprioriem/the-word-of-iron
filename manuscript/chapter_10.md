# Chapter Ten
## The Boundless Forest

Hawthorne took them out of the city and into the forest. He still had not explained what they were doing or where they were headed, and Marcus was beginning to question his decision. Rykker, Sev, and Viggo had also decided to take Mara up on her offer. Len had stayed behind in Senna to meet with their Governor to bring news of Gareth's death, and to help the Vallan refugees that found their way to the city. Mara, too, stayed in the city, claiming she had business elsewhere. She had wished them luck, assuring that they were in good hands.

Marcus felt as if he was abandoning everything as he always did. But that was what he did, was it not? Run? First Sen, his village, his kinsmen. And now his country. At the first chance he got, he ran from his problems when they became too big for him. In this case, though, did he have a choice? If what Mara said was true---if she was right about the role they had to play in all of this, then just maybe he was where he was supposed to be. He hoped he wasn't being played for a fool and falling into bad habits.

Their new guide took them deep into the wood north of Senna, outside of any road or well-traveled path. It was early morning, yet the sun barely pierced the thick canopy of the trees. It felt more like a perpetual twilight, and Marcus couldn't help but imagine that they were in another world entirely. A muffled quiet lay across the wilderness, as if all manner of creature, even insects stayed clear of the area.

Hawthorne led the way through the dense undergrowth without pause or so much as a look back. Surprisingly, Viggo and Rykker had barely said a word since leaving the city. This came as a shock to Marcus---they seemed to always have an opinion on everything. Perhaps the fear of the unknown, of what awaited, gave them pause. It was a hard thing, to both feel compelled to dig deeper and run as far away as possible.

Marcus tensed as he felt Hawthorne's pace slow and become more deliberate, as if sensing for something. Then, they stepped into a small clearing, just enough for each of them to have a space to stand. A stone monolith stood at the center of the clearing, slightly taller than Marcus. It looked old---no, ancient. Even older than the fateful temple they had found themselves in after the fall of Valla. Harsh, angular runes etched their way across it's surface in a language that he did not recognize. Although the stone was rough with wear, pocked and eroded in places, the runes themselves were still legible. The monolith, slightly askew, protruded from a small crater in the earth where no grass or shrub grew. A perfect circle encompassed the obelisk.

Marcus kept his distance from the thing---it was probably best to be cautious. Rykker pushed his way past, eyes locked on the slab. He nearly took a step down into the pit before Hawthorne reached out to stop him.

"Wait," the tall man said.

"What is it?" Rykkers eyes did not leave the center of the clearing.

"It is a gateway. A way to go where we need to go. To the Boundless Forest. Stay here." Without further explaination, Hawthorne climbed down into the crater and approached the monolith. It seemed to shrink in the presence of him. Marcus could not tell if that was a trick of the eye or something else.

Hawthorne laid a thin hand upon the stone and began to speak. Marcus frowned, realizing that he could not understand what the man was saying. No, that wasn't quite right. The words themselves vanished before him, snatched from the space between hearing and understanding. He was sure that the Hawthorne was talking, but the harder Marcus tried to focus on them, the more they slipped away. A faint white light shone from beneath the hand on the stone, spreading outwards to encompass the entire pillar. 

The light grew until Marcus could not keep his eyes open. He threw his arm up to protect his face as the illumation became blinding. As quickly as it came, it was gone. For a moment, patterns danced in the darkness, and he squeezed his eyes shut before open them, blinking the momentary bluriness away.

When his vision returned, his first thought was that nothing had changed. It did not take long, however, for his senses to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Although the clearing they now stood in looked nearly identical, Marcus was sure that they were no longer mere miles from Senna. Something about the way the air felt, the thickness of it, and the sky---he was sure the light was different here. More gray, somehow.

"Where are we?" he asked.

Hawthorne released his touch of the monolith and took a step back, looking around. For the first time, Marcus noticed a small smile. "This, my new friends, is Indenos. The Boundless Forest. The Wood."
