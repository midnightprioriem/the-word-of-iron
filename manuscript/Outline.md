## The Boundless Forest
### Marcus

- Walk through the Forest to the Monolith
- Hawthorne teleports them to Indenos
- Conversation where Hawthorne reveals what he knows about the place
	- Hawthorne, of course, is one of the Magi who helped build Indenos, but the only way he and Mara have been able to stay sane for thousands of years is by wiping their memories every couple of centuries. Most other Magi have either gone mad or died or killed themselves.
- On their way, a creature from the Beyond (Outer Realm, The Nightmare, *The Chaos Between Universes*), a leathery winged predator attacks them. Hawthorne is not worried, but warns them to kill it quickly

# Chapter 11
## Valley of Frost
### Viggo

- As they continue deeper into the Forest, Viggo notices that it is getting colder. He can start to see his own breath. He brings this up with Hawthorne
- Hawthorne tries to act calm, but it is clear something is wrong and he isn’t sure what it is
- Slowly, the landscape around them turns to snow, and pretty soon they are all freezing. Hawthorne was not expecting this—he explains to them that Indenos does not have seasons. It should always be the same temperature, and if something has upset that balance then it is the work of powerful Magic.
- Hawthorne leads them to a nearby Monolith. It seems that whatever is causing the blizzard in the Forest, the epicenter is here.
- Hawthorne thinks for a moment, then decides to take them across back to Asdel. Something is wrong, and he suspects something, but he won’t say what.
- On the other side, the land is, unsuprisingly, covered in snow. 
- When they ask where they are, Hawthorne tells them Seonteoch. Which of course none of them are familiar with.
	- He tells them that its a part of the Siunna Valley in Gyim.
	- They are half-shocked, half confused. Gyim is on the wrong side of Kador, near the North, whereas Antuza is much farther South. Hawthorne explains that the Forest does not work in linear paths or distances.
- Seontech is a small city, tucked neatly into a valley surrounded on all sides by well-worn mountains, their peaks just barely visible through the flurries of snow and fog.
- They make their way to an Inn called the Broken Crown. Hawthorne takes them to the owner, a man named Bjorn
	-  A thick, scraggly beard hides a wide, kind face, and twinkling brown eyes. Bjorn is the owner of the Inn, as well as barkeep, cook, and anything else he can get his hands on. He will comment on the strange weather, but say how it is good for business
	- Bjorn will tell Hawthorne that Cilia and Leane are at the Aratheum, and that there was some incident with Cilia’s daughter
- Hawthorne tells them they are going to the Aratheum

# Chapter 12
## The Aratheum
### Marcus

- They go to the library and meet others from the Vendori. Cilia and Leane confirm Hawthorne’s suspicions—a Scathe has been let loose in the valley, one that has not fed in too long. It has gone mad and caused the blizzard. 
- Hawthorne suspects that this was a deliberate act by Vanen to stop them.

## Chapter 13
### Whispers on the Wind
#### Viggo/Rykker

- They hunt the Scathe
- They are split up by the Blizzard, which continues to worsen. They hear the litte girl on the wind, and Viggo and Hawthorne track her voice.
- Meanwhile, Rykker Sev and Marcus find the girls body, covered and frost in the snow.
- Viggo and Hawthorne find the Scathe and fight it. They are able to kill it, but Hawthorne is injured in the process.
- Once the Scathe is dead, the Blizzard clears and everyone is able to re-unite.
- They take Hawthorne back to the Broken Crown.
- They realize that Hawthorne is in no shape to take them the rest of the way to Antuza through Indenos, but he assures them he just needs a day or two of rest. They have no other alternative, so they wait.

## Chapter 14
### The Undying
#### Rykker/Sev

- Sev learns about his past, and is given a gift

## Chapter 15
### A Chance Encounter
#### Viggo

- Viggo meets Faylen, an unexpected person from his past
- Faylen recognizes Viggo when he is browsing the library.
- He confronts her, asking what she wants
- She tells him she is a scribe at the Aratheum, but that she used to be an acolyte at the Church of the Triumvirate and she recognized him
- he is suspicious, wondering to himself if she was sent to kill him for disobeying the warning he received all those years ago
- she tells him her story to convince him otherwise 
- Faylen was indoctrinated into a sect of the church called the Sanguine Order, specifically for chosen individuals who have the Gift (Magic)

### Draft → Viggo talks to priest

"You are a smith?" The Odethi priest nodded his head towards the hammer at Viggo's belt.

"I used to be," Viggo answered.

"The pain in your eyes when you look upon it tells me that you've done more destroying than creating with it, I think." The priest shook his head slowly, running his delicate fingers through a cloud of white hair.

"You're very wise to think that." Viggo wrenched his eyes from the hammer and clasped his hands together, leaning on his knees.

"What troubles you? I sense uncertainty. A hesitance. What are you waiting for?"

Surprised, Viggo turned to face the priest. "I... I don't know."

He looked down again, and then the words came pouring out. He hadn't intended for it to happen, but something about the old man sitting next to him made them flow. "When I was a blacksmith, the work had purpose. There was always a clear answer for where to go next---a path forward. Lately, I've felt as though lost. Everywhere I look, there is no clear side, no right answer. I don't know up from down, or left from right. I feel as though I have strayed far from my path, or perhaps I was never even on it."

The priest was silent for a moment, then smiled, the creases in his face deepening. "There is a passage in the Book of Selach I'm familiar with. 'When confronted with a block of iron, most believe it to be unchanging, immutable, and unbreakable. The iron will always be what it is, and never what it is not. However, the blacksmith sees the iron for what it can be. And with blazing ardor, he melts it down, reshaping and molding the iron into something new, of his own resolve.' I've always liked that one."

The kind, knowing eyes of the priest studied Viggo. "I know not the truths of your past that make you feel as though you've strayed from some path, but I can assure you: there is no path but the one we forge ourselves."


## Viggo hurts vanen final confrontation

Viggo is knocked back against the wall. At this point he is pretty fucked, but still he gets up and picks up Fall's sword and charges Vanen on last time. Vanen catches the sword easily, turning it back on Viggo and stabbing him through the stomach. Viggo reaches behind his back with his other hand, grabbing his blacksmith's hammer that he concealed, and crushes Vanens skull with it. The gang has a heartfelt goodbye with Viggo, but he tells them to go, since Sev is already carrying Annet and they can't afford to be slow. Who knows what the corrupt priests or any other Scathe would do if they found them.
