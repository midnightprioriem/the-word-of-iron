# Chapter 10
### Marcus

- Walk through the Forest to the Monolith
- Hawthorne teleports them to Indenos
- Conversation where Hawthorne reveals what he knows about the place
	- Hawthorne, of course, is one of the Magi who helped build Indenos, but the only way he and Mara have been able to stay sane for thousands of years is by wiping their memories every couple of centuries. Most other Magi have either gone mad or died or killed themselves.
- On their way, a creature from the Beyond (Outer Realm, The Nightmare, *The Chaos Between Universes*), a leathery winged predator attacks them. Hawthorne is not worried, but warns them to kill it quickly
- Rykker takes samples from the creature once they’ve killed it. Marcus warns against it, but Hawthorne doesn’t seem to care too much, so he allows it.

# Chapter 11
## The Aratheum
### Viggo

- As they continue deeper into the Forest, Viggo notices that it is getting colder. He can start to see his own breath. He brings this up with Hawthorne
- Hawthorne tries to act calm, but it is clear something is wrong and he isn’t sure what it is
- Slowly, the landscape around them turns to snow, and pretty soon they are all freezing. Hawthorne was not expecting this—he explains to them that Indenos does not have seasons. It should always be the same temperature, and if something has upset that balance then it is the work of powerful Magic.
- Hawthorne leads them to a nearby Monolith. It seems that whatever is causing the blizzard in the Forest, the epicenter is here.
- Hawthorne thinks for a moment, then decides to take them across back to Asdel. Something is wrong, and he suspects something, but he won’t say what.
